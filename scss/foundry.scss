 *
 * FOUNDRY2
 * Based heavily on BEM principles, along with a smattering of inuitCSS / itCSS, FOUNDRY2 is Element Studio's
 * own CSS boilerplate for getting new user interfaces styled up quickly while keeping them looking swag, by
 * abstracting out the styling of commonly used patterns components.
 *
 * This SCSS file contains extra bits for displaying all our CSS nicely in a style guide. It is compiled from
 * a single extra SCSS file named, funnily enough, foundry.scss, which lives in the templates directory.
